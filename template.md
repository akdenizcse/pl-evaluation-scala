Abstract 

Maybe some of us have not been familiar with the powerful and flexible language like Scala until now or maybe even we have not heard about its name. But when we face with language there are some questions appear like this:
1 – Why this language is powerful?
2 – why some experts emphasis that this language is powerfuller than Java or Python?
3 – Does this language support functional programming and object-oriented programming?
4 – does this language can handle big data?
By improving science and technology and using internet, also big data appears. Nowadays processing and storing these data are the major problem of programmers and IT administrators which they face with this.
In this report we have tried to answer the questions which shown on top and familiar with the Scala language.



Introduction

By improving science and technology every human wants to make himself/herself life easy it this comes from which instinct of human. This has been proved throughout history by innovations and discoveries that man has potential to for growth and endeavor thus this features become reason to programmers to make a new language which they get best performance from this however their major target always have been making language with low code line and getting best performance.to make it clear, they have been wanted to make a language which forwarded them to target quickly. Scala in one of the well-known languages which you can get best, quick and optimized performance with low line code. We can explain this language that it is the result of open source revolution which firstly created by Richard Stallman. Scala is one of the languages which has potential to become more powerful with packages and macros, however this language is mixed of so many powerful languages to become upmost.



1 – Scala: language for future programming

When Martin Odersky designed pizza programming language, it affected the programming world, but this language never became popular. Soon he decided to design language which everyone can use it and update or upgrade it and, he wants to make this language mix of so many other languages. Therefore, this theory become the reason of designing Scala language in 2004.Scala`s syntax is so similar to java but so easier than that and most of java libraries can used in Scala. This language is mixed of language such as: C, Haskell, Ruby and Python.it supports both functional programming and object-oriented programming. One of best IDE for this language comes from Eclipse.


2 – Scala: Scalable 

Scala is the composition of two words: Scalable and language. Using this language every programmer can solve in any range of problems from little to big and because of that this name gave to this. It gives extensive perspective of coding and program making to programmer. Important note is for the first time Bigint data type comes for languages in comparison of other languages. This data type has presented for the first time in Eric Raymond book which can contain Up to thirty decimal digits. Designer of Scala makes it open source which it can help to programmers to develop it according to their requirements that this feature is incredible in contrast of other language. Scala has some commands like java but with low line of code for instance you can write 3 lines of java code in one line in Scala. You can also use java libraries in Scala easily. Scala shows that how can we mix structure of other language to invent and design new language. The first appearance and the first structure of Scala comes from java and C#, united object comes from Smalltalk, also it follows ruby structure, universal classified of it comes from Algol, Simula and Bet. All of this shows that Scala is integrated and expanded language.



3 – Supporting functional programming

Feature and theory of functional programming have been most important subject in programming languages, and we can say that the first language which support functional programming was Lisp. Therefore languages like Caml, Haskell , Erlang , SML , Scheme support this feature. For long time functional programming has taught in university and institutes but never used widely in application productions. Functional programming follows two major elements which these elements Have been implemented in Scala vey well. One of them is functions are from First class type which means entrance parameters can exit as output and returning value. Also, you can type one function within other function (nested elements) also you can use function without naming it in Scala. These are all special features of Scala



4 – Supporting object oriented 

Object-orients is a feature which it has been so successful in programming language. This feature was added to programming languages in 1960 in Simula and Smalltalk and it has been so famous until now. Also, you can see this type of programming and feature in Scala. For more information we can say that everything in Scala is an object, so if you if you are programming with Scala you mean you will work with objects. Additionally, each program needs a structure and this structured includes from data. Scala put all data in a container so we can say that containers all together create structure. Best idea of this type of programming is to makes the container public and using it without damaging it. Also, we can say that Scala see all operands as an object with it helps that to operands to save themselves in containers. This theory comes from Smalltalk and Scala use this too. Object oriented feature helps Scala to be more scalable 
By the way, we can also use Scala in big data programming which when we work with big data, we can use this language as programming language. Also, it is so compatible with Spark and Hadoop which they are two best frameworks for big data.





Conclusion:

Totally, We can explain that Scala is a public purpose language which programmers can use it for any target and this power comes from the core of Scala which supports functional and object-oriented programming, Also , java programmers can use it very easily due to similarity to syntax of java. Additionally, this language can be used in data mining and big data programming with help of frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. The only problem is this language does not have any special IDE like other popular languages but IDE like Eclipse or text editors like Visual Studio Code can be beneficial for this language 





Scala is easy to learn and general-purpores programming language,both object-oriented and highly functional programming language.
About Scala and It’s Features:
1)Scala is Completely Object-Oriented Programming Language:
Everything here is regarded as an object. Operations we conduct are termed as a method call. Scala let to users add operations to already existing classes.The best thing about Scala is that it makes it effortlessly easy to interact with Java Code.We can easily write a Java code inside Scala class.
2)Scala is a Functional Language:
Here are the characteristics of Functional Programming:
-Simplicity
-Power and Flexibility
-Suitable for Parallel Processing
3)Not Interpreted,Scala is a Compiler-Based Language:
Scala is a compiler-based language,it’s execution is relatively faster than Python,because Python is an interpreted language.The compiler in Scala Functions is just like a Java Compiler.
Important things to remember about Scala:
1)Scala is case-sensitive
2)When saving a Scala Program,use “.scala”
3)Scala execution process begins from main() methods
4)Identifier never can start with numbers


Which reasons encourages Java Developers to learn Scala?
Scala has many strong points,the strongest one is that Scala is a Multi-Paradigm Language.
1)Multi-Paradigm Language:
Scala is different than Java,because it supports two programming paradigms:
Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) and Functional Programming(FP).
For advancing programming skills, it’s better to learn at least one language from different paradigms and Scala gives chance to discover both FP and OOP.

2)Interoperability With Java:
Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can operate nicely with Java code.This also means Scala developers can use Java libraries directly from Scala code. It is also possible to call Scala code from Java, and you can easily write part of your program in Scala and the rest in Java.

3)Expressiveness
Scala certainly scores big over Java in expressiveness.
Scala is inherently very expressive. There’s also lots of really beautiful and useful code written in Scala.
This is attracting more and more Java developers to learn Scala, who like to write beautiful and clean code.
Here is the word count program written in both Java and Scala, you can see the difference in the expressiveness of language by yourself.
Scala has achieved in just one line what Java has taken more than 10 lines to achieve.

4)Marketable
Learning Scala will certainly make you more marketable. Many companies are using or migrating to Scala these days, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, and Quora. Given Scala’s marketing as Scalable language, the days are not far when the big investment banks and financial organizations will start looking Scala for their low-latency solutions.

5)Statically Typed
Statically typed languages like Java, avert programmers from doing bad things, but with a dynamic language like Python, we only know about a bad thing when we run the program.
Scala has the best of both. It feels dynamic, but it’s strongly statically typed. The Scala compiler is really smart and uses type-inference to it’s fullest extent.
Scala provides type inference for variables and functions, much better than the limited type inference in Java and C#.

6)Growing Frameworks
Scala is growing programming language.There are lots of good libraries and frameworks coming around.Companies that have started using Scala are also contributing to the recent growth of Scala as a mainstream language.
There are some nice Scala web frameworks out there, including Lift and Play.
Akka, another Scala-Based concurrent framework has already established itself as toolkit.Scala is also been used in Big Data space along with Apache Spark, which has further fuelled it’s adoption by many Java developers interested in Big Data.



Here are the top 5 IDEs and text editors for Scala:

1)Eclipse:
Eclipse IDE for Scala provides dedicated support for developing pure Scala and mixed applications. Scala IDE 3.0 offers a whole host of tools and features for developers, along with a few notable bug fixes. There is a Scala debugger which makes everything easier, along with a reliable test finder and an asynchronous debugger. Scala IDE is Open-Source and available under the Scala License.

2)Ensime:
Ensime is something with a mix of two items. Emacs and Atom are both text editors with excellent support for Scala, but today we are focusing on the Ensime. Ensime is a library software designed to brings Scala and Java IDE-like features to your favorite text editor.
ENSIME is not precisely a text editor or IDE. In order to make use of it, you need a build tool, an. ensime file, and a text editor. The build tool downloads the ensime-server and the text editor launches it. While this is slightly more involved than most IDEs, the benefits are impressive.
Developers can jump to source code or the documentation easily. ENSIME shows inferred types, supports refactoring, and most importantly, red squiggly lines appear in your code to highlight errors and warnings. Ensime is a free software that relies on donations and sponsorship from developers.

3)Intellij Idea:
While IntelliJ Idea is a technically an IDE for Java, the IDE provides support for lots of other languages like Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript and SQL.
In addition to the host of features, IntelliJ IDEA offers Scala-specific support in testing with Scala Test. This lets developers perform unit testing easily. Other features include smart completion, language injection, an editor-centric environment, and lots of useful build tools. While IntelliJ Idea Ultimate requires purchase and a yearly subscription, the Community version is open source.

4)Netbeans:
NetBeans IDE allows developers to quickly and easily develop desktop, mobile and web applications. It has many features for editing, analyzing, and converting, NetBeans IDE makes things easier for developers. The Scala plugin for NetBeans features a full Scala editor, complete with syntax and semantic coloring, an outline navigator, code completion, and more. There is also a debugger, an interactive console, and integration with Junit and Maven. NetBeans is free, open source, and moving to Apache.


5)VIM:
Vim is a text editor for developers who really want to customize their own experience. In fact, this is sometimes the main complaint about Vim: developers must install a lot of plugins in order to really get the environment they want. People said that Vim’s got a number of Scala plugins to make it work.
"Vim-Scala" is a good baseline plugin to have to manage the syntax. A popular code completion plugin is "deoplete.nvim", a dark powered asynchronous completion framework."fzf" is an independent command line program for Vim that handles things like Jump to File and Jump to Definition. Using all three of these plugins together can make the Scala experience really work in Vim. Vim is open source.




How to Setup Scala Programming Language in different Platforms?

For Windows:
First, make sure you have the Java 8 JDK (or Java 11 JDK) installed.
To check, open the terminal and type:
java -version(Make sure you have version 1.8 or 11.)

       def main(args: Array[String]) {
        
           /**declare a variable*/
             var number= (-100);
       
           if(number==0){
               println("number is zero");
           }
           else if(number>0){
               println("number is positive");
           }
           else{
               println("number is negative");
           }
       }
    }

OUTPUT:”number is negative”


3)Scala program to demonstrate example of multiple variables declarations and assignments:

object ExampleVarDecAndAssin {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      
      var (name: String, age: Int) = Pair("Rashad",21);

      //print values
      println("Name:   "+name);
      println("Age:    "+age);
      
      //declaration without specifying data type
      var (address,mobile)=Pair("Antalya, Turkey",1234567890);
      
      //print values
      println("Address:   "+address);
      println("Mobile:    "+mobile);      
            
   }
}

OUTPUT:
Name:   Rashad
Age:    21
Address:   Antalya, Turkey
Mobile:    1234567890


4)Scala program to print numbers from 1 to 100 using for loop:

object ExampleForLoop1 {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var counter: Int=0;
      
      for(counter <- 1 to 100)
        print(counter + " ");
    
      // to print new line
      println();
   }
}

OUTPUT:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 


 5)Scala program of array - Declare, print and calculate sum of all elements:

object ExampleArray1 {
    
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
       
      var numbers = Array(10,20,30,40,50);
      var N:Int=0;
      
      //print all array elements
      println("All array elements: ");
      for ( N <- numbers ) {
         println(N);
      }
      //calculating SUM of all elements
      var sum: Int=0;
      for ( N <- numbers ) {
         sum+=N;
      }      
      println("Sum of all array elements: "+sum);

   }
}

OUTPUT:
All array elements: 
10
20
30
40
50
Sum of all array elements: 150
