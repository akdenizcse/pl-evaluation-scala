Abstract 

Maybe some of us have not been familiar with the powerful and flexible language like Scala until now or maybe even we have not heard about its name. But when we face with language there are some questions appear like this:
1 – Why this language is powerful?
2 – why some experts emphasis that this language is powerfuller than Java or Python?
3 – Does this language support functional programming and object-oriented programming?
4 – does this language can handle big data?
By improving science and technology and using internet, also big data appears. Nowadays processing and storing these data are the major problem of programmers and IT administrators which they face with this.
In this report we have tried to answer the questions which shown on top and familiar with the Scala language.



Introduction

By improving science and technology every human wants to make himself/herself life easy it this comes from which instinct of human. This has been proved throughout history by innovations and discoveries that man has potential to for growth and endeavor thus this features become reason to programmers to make a new language which they get best performance from this however their major target always have been making language with low code line and getting best performance.to make it clear, they have been wanted to make a language which forwarded them to target quickly. Scala in one of the well-known languages which you can get best, quick and optimized performance with low line code. We can explain this language that it is the result of open source revolution which firstly created by Richard Stallman. Scala is one of the languages which has potential to become more powerful with packages and macros, however this language is mixed of so many powerful languages to become upmost.




1 – Scala: language for future programming

When Martin Odersky designed pizza programming language, it affected the programming world, but this language never became popular. Soon he decided to design language which everyone can use it and update or upgrade it and, he wants to make this language mix of so many other languages. Therefore, this theory become the reason of designing Scala language in 2004.Scala`s syntax is so similar to java but so easier than that and most of java libraries can used in Scala. This language is mixed of language such as: C, Haskell, Ruby and Python.it supports both functional programming and object-oriented programming. One of best IDE for this language comes from Eclipse.



2 – Scala: Scalable 

Scala is the composition of two words: Scalable and language. Using this language every programmer can solve in any range of problems from little to big and because of that this name gave to this. It gives extensive perspective of coding and program making to programmer. Important note is for the first time Bigint data type comes for languages in comparison of other languages. This data type has presented for the first time in Eric Raymond book which can contain Up to thirty decimal digits. Designer of Scala makes it open source which it can help to programmers to develop it according to their requirements that this feature is incredible in contrast of other language. Scala has some commands like java but with low line of code for instance you can write 3 lines of java code in one line in Scala. You can also use java libraries in Scala easily. Scala shows that how can we mix structure of other language to invent and design new language. The first appearance and the first structure of Scala comes from java and C#, united object comes from Smalltalk, also it follows ruby structure, universal classified of it comes from Algol, Simula and Bet. All of this shows that Scala is integrated and expanded language.



3 – Supporting functional programming

Feature and theory of functional programming have been most important subject in programming languages, and we can say that the first language which support functional programming was Lisp. Therefore languages like Caml, Haskell , Erlang , SML , Scheme support this feature. For long time functional programming has taught in university and institutes but never used widely in application productions. Functional programming follows two major elements which these elements Have been implemented in Scala vey well. One of them is functions are from First class type which means entrance parameters can exit as output and returning value. Also, you can type one function within other function (nested elements) also you can use function without naming it in Scala. These are all special features of Scala



4 – Supporting object oriented 

Object-orients is a feature which it has been so successful in programming language. This feature was added to programming languages in 1960 in Simula and Smalltalk and it has been so famous until now. Also, you can see this type of programming and feature in Scala. For more information we can say that everything in Scala is an object, so if you if you are programming with Scala you mean you will work with objects. Additionally, each program needs a structure and this structured includes from data. Scala put all data in a container so we can say that containers all together create structure. Best idea of this type of programming is to makes the container public and using it without damaging it. Also, we can say that Scala see all operands as an object with it helps that to operands to save themselves in containers. This theory comes from Smalltalk and Scala use this too. Object oriented feature helps Scala to be more scalable 
By the way, we can also use Scala in big data programming which when we work with big data, we can use this language as programming language. Also, it is so compatible with Spark and Hadoop which they are two best frameworks for big data.





Conclusion:

Totally, We can explain that Scala is a public purpose language which programmers can use it for any target and this power comes from the core of Scala which supports functional and object-oriented programming, Also , java programmers can use it very easily due to similarity to syntax of java. Additionally, this language can be used in data mining and big data programming with help of frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. The only problem is this language does not have any special IDE like other popular languages but IDE like Eclipse or text editors like Visual Studio Code can be beneficial for this language
